# 🚀 Skill Tracker

A public, daily log of my learning, practice, and project work as a developer.  
This repository exists to build **consistency, accountability, and visible growth** over time.

I use this tracker to document **what I learn, what I practice, what I build, and how I improve**—every single day.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Track daily progress across multiple skills
- Build a strong habit of learning + execution
- Maintain a clean, readable public learning log
- Show real consistency and professional workflow on GitHub

This is not just notes — this is **proof of work**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> Learn → Practice → Build → Reflect → Repeat

Every day is divided into **4 structured phases** that mirror a real developer’s workflow.
