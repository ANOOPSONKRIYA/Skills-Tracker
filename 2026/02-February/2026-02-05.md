> Focus: C++ Inheritance, Problem Solving, Member Panel Development

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: LEARN (10:00 – 12:00)

**Topic:** Inheritance in C++ (Functions & Accessing Members)

- [x] Theory understood
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] At least 1 problem solved
- [ ] Notes created
- [ ] Flashcards added

**Key takeaway:**  
> Understood how inherited functions work in C++, including access specifiers and function calls across base and derived classes. Still need clarity on one inheritance-related problem.
