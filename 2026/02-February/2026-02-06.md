## 🪞 Reflection & Tomorrow

**💡 What worked well today:**  
> Strong progress on a real C++ project and better understanding of Node.js with EJS.

**🚧 Blockers / Challenges:**  
> No problem-solving practice today; need to balance learning with DSA again.

**🎯 Tomorrow's Single Top Priority:**  
> Solve at least 2 practice problems and continue refining the Student Management System.

**⚙️ Adjustments for tomorrow:**  
> Allocate a fixed 60–90 minute slot strictly for problem solving.
